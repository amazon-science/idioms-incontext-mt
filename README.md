## Idioms in Context Dataset

This repository contains the "Idioms in Context" dataset used in our ACL 2024 paper: [The Fine-Tuning Paradox: Boosting Translation Quality Without Sacrificing LLM Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20089).

### Description
The dataset consists of idiomatic expressions in context and their human-written translations. It covers 2 language pairs (English-German and English-Russian) with 3 translation directions:
1. English &rarr; German
2. German &rarr; English
3. Russian &rarr; English

The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of large language models and machine translation systems in handling idiomatic expressions, which can be challenging due to their non-literal meanings.

### Usage
